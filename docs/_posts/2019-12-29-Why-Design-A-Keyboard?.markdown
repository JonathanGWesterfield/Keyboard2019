## Inception
I thought up the concept of a keyboard with a left handed number pad during freshman year of college back in Spring 2016. The thought came to me after suffering through an experience with Microsoft Excel. Since I wasn't yet proficient with Excel at that point, working with spreadsheets for chemistry was extremely slow going as I had to move my hands between typing, entering numbers, using the arrow keys, and moving and clicking with the mouse. It was frustrating and time consuming to move my hands and reset each time I needed to do something and I figured that at the very least, a left handed number pad should be able to cut out a large portion of the hand movement. However, when I searched online if any of these keyboards existed, all I found were either incredibly expensive keyboards or lazy attempts at selling a keyboard marketed for left handed people. Many left handed keyboards weren't even designed for left handed people! They were just a reflected right handed layout with the number pad being completely backwards (the zero key should be under the thumb but never was) and having the arrow keys on the left. You can see a picture of that poor layout below. Simply put, they were bad. I decided that if I truly wanted what I thought in my head, I was going to have to do it myself.

Notice how the number pad makes no sense. The "0" key should always rest beneath the thumb. The "+" and "Enter" keys should always be hit by the pinky finger. The top row of the number pad should be reflected ("-", "*", "/", "Num Lock").

## First Attempt
I started my first attempt during the Summer of 2016 using a guide from Matt3o. It was a fantastic guide that took you through, step by step, the process of building a keyboard from scratch. You can find a link to that guide [here](https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?t=6050) and the page on programming the keyboard controller [here](https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=7177&start=). That keyboard used modified Matias Alps switches. I basically took the stem from the quiet 'tactile' switch and put that into the housing of the clicky switch. The stems from the quiet switches have rubber dampeners built into the stem to dampen the sound when bottoming out and returning. This coupled with a clicky leaf spring from the other housing gave me a fantastic clicky keyboard that was quiet enough to take to work (which I did for 2 internships). To this day, this modified switch is among my favorites, even above the IBM Model M because I can actually take it to work without deafening coworkers and it's so tactile. Unfortunately, there were some unforseen issues with this Alps keyboard that I could only find out by building and using it.

## Issues With First Keyboard
There were several minor issues with the keyboard layout. First, because my keyboard layout was different and didn't have any arrow keys, anyone who needed to use my keyboard (getting help from a coworker), couldn't easily use it. Secondly, the function key used to switch between layer used the F1 key from the keycaps kit and was too small. I would often miss that key and hit the F2 key (Windows key) on accident so the WASD characters would get typed instead. Next, it turns out that the WASD keys are actually not the best arrow keys. During my first internship, I would constantly be switching from typing to using the arrow keys. Since WASD is shifted one key to the left on the keyboard, I would constantly be shifting my hands. This became an issue when I would lose track of which keys my fingers were hovering over; WASD or home row keys? This led to lots of typing mistakes when using terminal environments or just navigating my code and trying to type. Finally and most importantly, my left handed number pad didn't work as intended. I reflected the actual numbers on the pad thinking that my left hand would instinctually adjust. However, turns out that your left hand *actually* carries muscle memory from your right hand. This meant that if I needed to type the number 3, my index finger would instinctually hit the 1 key. This happened *frequently* and got very annoying. However, this could easily be fixed my reprogramming the keyboard controller, which leads into the next issue. 

Because I handwired they keyboard together instead of using a printed circuit board (PCB), I couldn't pull the keycaps off to rearrange the layout because doing so would tear up the wiring underneath of the keyboard. I could use pliers to hold the switch while pulling the keycaps from the other side, but there is still too much risk since Alps keycaps stick to the key *much* stronger. There was no turning back as soon as the keycaps were put on the switches. 

To make matters worse, the handwired matrix underneath the keyboard is much more fragile than a PCB. This manifested in some keys either bouncing (registering twice), or not working at all. For example, the 1 key (next to the escape key) would either fail to register that I pressed it, or it would register twice. The Caps Lock key just simply didn't work or would only work if struck very hard (I know because I'm currently typing on it).

Speaking of keycaps, despite how much I *love* the Alps switches, there are almost _*zero*_ keycap sets for them. There were only 2 key cap sets I could find and they were actually different colors of the same set. I could also get keycaps from an older Alps keyboard, like the Apple II keyboard, but it didn't make financial sense to buy a whole different keyboard just to scavenge keycaps. Older keyboards have a market, believe it or not, and they can still be pricey even if they don't work. This made me envious of all of the better keycap sets that MX switches get to have. To make matters worse, the first key cap set I ordered (which is just a different color of the same set I currently have) didn't come with all of the keycaps! 

While there was so much done right on this keyboard, it could definitely improved. I will detail the build plan for an improved keyboard in the next post.
