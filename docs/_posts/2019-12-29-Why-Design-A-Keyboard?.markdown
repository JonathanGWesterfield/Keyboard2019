I thought up the concept of a keyboard with a left handed number pad during freshman year of college back in Spring 2016. The thought came to me after suffering through an experience with Microsoft Excel. Since I wasn't yet proficient with Excel at that point, working with spreadsheets for chemistry was extremely slow going as I had to move my hands between typing, entering numbers, using the arrow keys, and moving and clicking with the mouse. It was frustrating and time consuming to move my hands and reset each time I needed to do something and I figured that at the very least, a left handed number pad should be able to cut out a large portion of the hand movement. However, when I searched online if any of these keyboards existed, all I found were either incredibly expensive keyboards or lazy attempts at selling a keyboard marketed for left handed people. Many left handed keyboards weren't even designed for left handed people! They were just a reflected right handed layout with the number pad being completely backwards (the zero key should be under the thumb but never was) and having the arrow keys on the left. You can see a picture of that poor layout below. Simply put, they were bad. I decided that if I truly wanted what I thought in my head, I was going to have to do it myself.

*Notice how the number pad makes no sense. The "0" key should always rest beneath the thumb. The "+" and "Enter" keys should always be hit by the pinky finger. The top row of the number pad should be reflected ("-", "*", "/", "Num Lock").*

In the next post, I will walk through the first keyboard that came out of this idea.
